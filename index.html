    <h1>Top Science Misconceptions</h1>

    <p class="text-white first">A major goal of education is the debunking of miseducation. That means spotting and
        correcting the
        many myths
        emanating from the internet, folk wisdom, and word of mouth. We have all been taken in, at some point or
        another, by a modern myth. Fortunately, we're here to help you with a new series debunking many of these modern
        myths. This installment aims to clear up some commonly held misconceptions in the field of science. The truth,
        as they say, shall set you free.

    <h1> Humans use only 10% of their brains</h1>
    <p class="text-white second"> Human brain is quite busy all day and night using about 20% of the body's resources
        and never really “turning
        off” until
        death. Meanwhile, most every part of the brain is busy doing all sorts of things even when you aren't paying
        attention. In fact, various parts of your brain are active all the time, far more than the mythical 10%.
        Depending on how you use your brain, and how you care for it, there's always the possibility of tapping into
        unrealized potential but it's not because your gray matter was sitting idle before. Learning a new skill,
        gaining a new memory, or thinking about a person's face can all stimulate your brain in different ways but they
        aren't activating an unused part. Instead, they are utilizing an active part for a new purpose.

    <h1>Bats are blind</h1>
    <p class="text-white third">
        They lack color receptors; but in low light, we can't see colors either. Try it some time. On a dark night or in
        a pitch black room, turn on a flashlight and point it at something colorful; then slowly cover the light till
        that color fades into shades of black and white. Perhaps this myth about blind bats arose from the fact that
        bats don't see as well as we can in daylight, or because they have sonar and can navigate without sight. They
        see just fine for their environment. We could say that bats see better than most referees, but that's not saying
        much.

    <h1> Egg Yolks Are Bad for You</h1>
    <p class="text-white fourth">
        The delicious yellow center of eggs get a bad rap from health reports, says Mashfika Alam, a doctor with online
        health consultancy iCliniq, who urges that we reconsider the belief that egg yolk can cause heart disease or
        atherosclerosis due to its “bad cholesterol.”

        “Maybe because people only got to know the health benefits of egg yolk only recently, but egg yolk is
        recommended for everyone unless allergic, even people with heart disease as it is loaded with HDL which is a
        good cholesterol and actually counteracts the effects of bad cholesterol,” says Alam. “Hence one egg a day for
        everyone, unless allergic, at least five days a week is a good thing.”

    <h1>Lightning never strikes the same place twice</h1>
    <P class="text-white fifth">
        This myth is not only wrong, it's dangerously wrong. Lightning often strikes the same place twice, at least
        within a close vicinity. If you find yourself standing around outdoors during a lightning storm, there is no
        outdoorsman or forecaster who'd recommend you go stand where lightning has already struck as if you are somehow
        protected at that spot. Instead, you need to find shelter, stay away from windows and avoid touching anything
        metal or electrical. And it's always a good idea to suspend your golf game or kite-flying till the storm passes.
    </P>
    <h1>Bananas grow on Trees</h1>
    <p class="text-white sixth">
        Bananas grow on something the size of trees, but the Banana "tree" is not actually a tree. The banana plant,
        which can grow up to 25 feet, is actually the world's largest perennial herb. When you carefully inspect a
        banana plant, you'll notice that it doesn't have woody fibers. It has strong stalks and leaves, yet it lacks the
        trunk and branches that would qualify it as a tree. Another related fact is that bananas are berries, since they
        don't produce mature seeds. So does that mean a banana split is a “herb berry” Sundae?

    <h1>The mustard seed is the smallest seed</h1>
    <p class="text-white seventh">
        The smallest seed on record is the orchid seed. But even though the mustard seed isn't the smallest, it's still
        pretty small, especially when compared to other seeds sown by ancient and modern gardeners. This myth has
        biblical origins. In the biblical account, Jesus is reported as saying that faith is like the mustard seed,
        which is "the smallest seed on earth" yet it grows to be the largest garden plant giving shelter to birds of the
        air (Mark 4:30-32). The error may be in the mind of the reader, interpreting literally what was a generalization
        or hyperbole (exaggerated phrasing common in informal language). Moreover, the mustard seed was quite possibly
        the smallest seed that that audience would have known, and it could have produced the largest garden plant they
        would have had in their gardens in ancient Israel.

    <h1>We have five senses</h1>
    <p class="text-white eight">
        Besides the five empirical senses (sight/visual, sound/auditory, touch/tactile, taste/gustatory, and
        smell/olfactory), there are at least four other senses that are rarely cited: proprioception—sensing one's
        orientation in space; thermoception—sense of temperature; equilibrioception—sense of balance; and
        interoception—sense of one's physiological condition. The next time someone talks about their "5 senses," you
        can say that you have "9 senses" and then sit back and let them think you have superpowers.

    <h1>Bulls become angry at the color red</h1>
    <p class="text-white ninth">
        Bulls are color blind They are, however, testy and defensive creatures that will charge when threatened,
        frightened, angry or just annoyed. Their fight or flight instinct is simply biased toward "fight." In bull
        fights, the matador may wield a red cape (the muleta), but it is the matador's taunting, threats, and overall
        behavior that make the bull charge. Bulls don't mind the sight of red, but they do however get angry at the
        sight of jerks. But who can blame them for that?
    </p>
    <h1> There are only three states of matter: solid, liquid and gas</h1>
    <p class="text-white tenth">
        Don't forget plasma. That makes four states. Plasma isn't some gel or goo, it's more like superheated ions and
        electrons. It's sometimes called “ionized gas.” When cooled, it becomes gas, but then it takes on different
        properties, too. So it's not quite right to think of it as a kind of “gas.” Plasma is more like a flame.
        Lightning, fire, the sun, and the tail of comets are all plasmas. Most any element or chemical compound can
        become plasma if heated high enough, but since plasma is just ions and electrons, the molecules have broken
        down. Water, for example, can be reduced to plasma, but it's no longer H2O; it's not even hydrogen or oxygen.
        And You definitely wouldn't want to drink it.
